Maybe because I've been reading “Aramis, or the Love of Technology” by Latour.

I've aways had Pokemon Go hanging over me when I make AR(t). I feel like I'm going to be explaining what I'm doing to somebody and they're going to say "oh, you mean like Pokemon Go?". Suddenly this morning I thought “what if we extend the frame?”. The Field of AR contains Pokemon Go. Rather than just ignoring the elephant in the room, why not bring that in as a component and play with it?

Instead of stupid, cute pokemon we could have amazing, diverse creatures with lives and connections to the community. Instead of capturing them, we do something else - like pay tribute to them like at a Shinto shrine. Different groups could be involved in the design of their creature and it's backstory.

[3] Here's an idea. Everyone knows how to use Pokemon Go. It's the AR thing that serious artists and everyone else trying to progress AR tries to ignore. Suddenly this morning I thought “what if we extend the frame?”. The Field of AR contains Pokemon Go. Rather than just ignoring the elephant in the room, why not bring that in as a component and play with it?
