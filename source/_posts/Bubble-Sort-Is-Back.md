I'm going to use WebXR to do an AR version of Bubble-Sort. I got ported it to GoodThing and got it working again.

<http://bubble-sort-v3.brokenbaysoftware.co/>

I did Selection-Sort at the same time:

<http://selection-sort-v3.brokenbaysoftware.co/>

I plugged in URL variables, like so:

<https://selection-sort-v3.brokenbaysoftware.co/?fps=10&max_seconds_transition_interval=3&cols=10&rows=10&show_working=true&loop=false&reload_interval=5000&constant_transition_speed=false>

My plan is to make it big and put it outside Google HQ in Pyrmont. It will have enough squares that it will take a long time to sort - like, thousands of years.
