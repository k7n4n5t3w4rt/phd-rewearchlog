S-Curves are a [maths thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function). Their application in business strategy comes from [Charles Handy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/894950.The_Empty_Raincoat)

Dave Snowden [linked them with Moore's Crossing The Chasm](http://cognitive-edge.com/blog/cycles-chasms-and-the-hype-curve/) and, [gradually]](http://cognitive-edge.com/blog/taken-at-the-flood/) found his way to [apex preditor theory](https://cognitive-edge.com/blog/it-never-troubles-the-wolf-how-many-the-sheep-may-be/)

Simon Wardley also [references s-curves](https://youtu.be/cel1vT0q1T8?t=2426), which is particularly interesting in terms of his ideas on the natural evolution of things from genesis, through custom and product, to commodity.
