> I had the opportunity when making this exhibition at Mona to work... on the first augmented reality piece that I've worked on. It's kind of a layer that sits on top of almost all of the exhibition experience. So, the sculptures and the experiences in every room are enriched by this augmented reality layer. Not only is it like a kind of experiential thing but I've also addressed what it means to be walking with a device in your hand - ...an i-device like an iPod - and also what that device does and what the hardware that augmented reality necessitates means for a viewers relationship to the museum and your experience of being in the museum

> Here on this side of the room in the con second part of the exhibition products for formalized organizations. You get kind of a look into a couple of management strategies - agile being one of them and Holacracy (sic) being another - which enable this type of emergent space to exist within larger much more formalized organizations like the GCHQ or Zappos or even Apple.
