I plan to set a constraint for myself: I use vanilla JS with the bare minimum of libraries - like Preact or React.

One practical reason is that the space is in flux and there are competing proprietary libraries for web AR. Not all of them will survive. The lesson from ManifestAR is not to build your art on somebody else's platform.

Another reason is that the makers of the various competing libraries and products are doing the same thing. It puts me in the same space as them.

Also, I want to feel the limits and possibilities of AR on the web very directly. I want to work very deeply with the technology, not be caught up in trying to do the next shiny thing with AR.

UPDATE: It turns out there are a lot of useful libraries for working with location. I probably need to refine this constraint:

-   I can use services, like Firebase because that's the web these days
-   I can use NodeJS or other Javascript libraries created by other people, as long as they're not dependent on a service.
