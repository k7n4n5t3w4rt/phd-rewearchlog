I think maybe because we're coders - and maybe because we're essentially building a better version of ButlerBot - we were shying away from the whole “bot” thing. It occurred to me this week that the “setup” process should really be the “set up your bot”, or even “my bot”, process.

When BenkoBot runs, I always get a shock to see things attributed to me because it was my API key and token that authenticated against the Trello API. I know I will feel much better about it when I see things attributed to the “BenkoBot”.

”The BenkoBot”. It's the bot that did it, not me officer. Why don't you ask him about that Trello comment?

I think it's because Adrian and I are using the same Trello board a lot. We're looking out for each other's comments. Once I made a bot that commented “Well done getting this one through to Done” and Adrian assumed it was my personal comment and responded. Kind of awkward. Awkward is not a selling point.
