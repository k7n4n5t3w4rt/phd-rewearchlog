Practice-based research (in the UTS sense), explores questions about the creative act itself (https://youtu.be/b1xQ0eMxZJU?t=230). Practice-led research uses practice to inform research. I'm mixing both things.

There are three interlocking research questions

1. Complexity <---> Art: Can complexity theory be operationalised to support or inform the practice of artmaking?

2. Art <---> Software: How might artists work most effectively with technology. Can we avoid or address the criticisms levelled at earlier practices such as net art or locative art?

3. Software <---> Complexity: Exploring the relationship between software and complexity:

-   Networks, platforms and algorithms increasing complexity and speed of change
-   What possibilities do software toolds open up for us - eg. new ways to work more effectively with complexity
-   Teams making software as a model for working with complex systems
