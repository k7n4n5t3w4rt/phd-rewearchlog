I needed to learn how to code again and I couldn't bare the thought of ploughing into create-react-app again. Somehow I got onto [Snowpack](https://legacy.snowpack.dev/#quick-start) and Preact etc. It seems like there's an updated to Snowpack I need to look into.

So, I made a boilerplate for new projects that don't need to be compiled during development:

I also wrote a test framework called "Testy" that's part of the repo. There are better test frameworks out there but Testy is lightweight and runs as javascript, not as a binary, so I can just run it in VSCode debug mode.
