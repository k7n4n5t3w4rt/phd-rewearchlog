So far we've been focusing on making the thing work. We were doing that developer thing - assuming that once the thing works people will flock to use it. but they're not. BenkoBot uses code and Trello users like Trello because it isn't code.

There's that. But also, it just doesn't have a personality. There's no brand. I think we need to really turn up the “botness” of BenkoBot so that even if people don't want to use it at least they know where it stands. You make a bot and it's your bot.

The BenkoBot logo is good. I think I can do something with that maybe. Of maybe a “great robots of history” sort of thing. Anyway, I'm going to start by changing the `/setup` page to be all about setting up your bot.
