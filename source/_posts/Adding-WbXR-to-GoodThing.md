I signed up for some online tutes from <https://www.webxracademy.com/> because things have moved on in the last year since I did any coding - both with the WebXR API itself and with the way people are using it.

I've added a couple of WebXR endpoints to GoodThing that imports ThreeJS and some of the nice utilities that people are making to make WebXR easier:

There's this nice library called "Eruda" that adds a devtools UI as an overlay for mobile:

There's a good status module from Three.js:
