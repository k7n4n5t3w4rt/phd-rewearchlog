# Week 2

## Activity 4

*Q: Make a list of any evidence that exists to support your belief that your proposed research is worthwhile and necessary*

  >I think we've been growing a sort of prosthetic extended nervous system for the last hundred years or so and its really starting to take, you know? It's rich. It's really starting to grow now. We're dealing with something that has penetrated virtually every corner of the human universe now. It's increasingly difficult to find people who have not been affected by media. It's very difficult to find non mediated human beings (Gibson 2000)

People have been thinking about, and building, "mirror worlds" since William Gibson coined the term "cyberspace" in 1982. Before that, really. But even Gibson didn't foresee the way we would be mix the digital and the real.  The so called "internet of things" is entering a phase of rapid development. Low level 5G networks and high-level "web of things" protocols, improvements in GPS and machine learning, the development of consumer level XR ("extended reality") interface technologies are all converging to enmesh the internet into our physical lives.

How have we changed in the last hundred years - or even in the last 40 years or so
Our experiences of the "real" are about to become heavily mediated by digital technology in a way that few of us can imagine and none of us have experienced. The effects of this change over the next decade may be more profound than the changes we have experienced since the internet was invented.


  >When we were only several hundred-thousand years old, we built stone circles, water clocks. Later, someone forged an iron spring, set clockwork running, imagined grid-lines on a globe. Cathedrals are like machines defining the soul; bells of clock towers stitch the sleeper’s dreams together. You see? So we’ve always been on our way to this new place ― that is no place, really ― but is real. It’s our nature to represent: we’re the animal that represents, the sole and only maker of maps. And if our weakness has been to confuse the bright and bloody colors of our calendars with the true weather of days, and the parchment’s territory of our maps with the lands spread out before us ― never mind. We've always been on our way to this new place ― that is no place, really ― but is real (Gibson 2000).
