# Week 2

## Activity 4

Q: Make a list of any evidence that exists to support your belief that your proposed research is worthwhile and necessary

People have been thinking about, and building, "mirror worlds" since William Gibson coined the term "cyberspace" in 1982. In 2000, Gibson said "We're sort of on some kind of cusp of change that I assume is technologically driven. It's not legislated change. It's just happening. We're in...we're in something. We're in something here, and it's...it's out of control." Now, a decade later, so called "XR" (extended reality) technology is becoming available to ordinary people. Our experiences are about to become heavily mediated by this technology in a leap that will probably affect us at least as much as the development of mobile computing - and will possibly be more profound.
