# Week 2

## Activity 4

*Q: Make a list of any evidence that exists to support your belief that your proposed research is worthwhile and necessary*

People have been thinking about, and building, "mirror worlds" since William Gibson coined the term "cyberspace" in 1982. Before that, really. In 2000, Gibson said

  "when we were only several hundred-thousand years old, we built stone circles, water clocks. Later, someone forged an iron spring, set clockwork running, imagined grid-lines on a globe. Cathedrals are like machines defining the soul; bells of clock towers stitch the sleeper’s dreams together. You see? So we’ve always been on our way to this new place ― that is no place, really ― but is real. It’s our nature to represent: we’re the animal that represents, the sole and only maker of maps. And if our weakness has been to confuse the bright and bloody colors of our calendars with the true weather of days, and the parchment’s territory of our maps with the lands spread out before us ― never mind. We've always been on our way to this new place ― that is no place, really ― but is real.”

Now, a decade later, our experiences are about to become even heavily mediated by technology. The effgects of this change over the next decase will probably be more profound.

  *    So called "XR" (extended reality) technology is becoming available to ordinary people.
  *   The so called "internet of things" is entering a phase of rapid development. Low level 5G protocols and high-level "web of things" protocols, improvements in GPS and machine learning all converging to expand the internet much further into our physical lives
