People have been thinking about, and building, "mirror worlds" since William Gibson coined the term "cyberspace" in 1982. In 2000, Gibson said "We're sort of on some kind of cusp of change that I assume is technologically driven. It's not legislated change. It's just happening. We're in...we're in something. We're in something here, and it's...it's out of control."
Now, a decade later, our experiences are about to become even heavily mediated by technology. The effgects of this change over the next decase will probably be more profound.

*   The so called "internet of things" is entering a phase of rapid development. Low level 5G protocols and high-level "web of things" protocols, improvements in GPS and machine learning all converging to expand the internet much further into our physical lives
