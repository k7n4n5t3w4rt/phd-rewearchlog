## Ontology

I’m a relativist. I think “reality exists as social, mental and experiential constructs”. To the extent that we all share these constructs - or appear to - then I’m also a constructivist. That which we might call “consensus reality” appears to exist and follow natural laws, with which we can work.

I have internalised another paradigm as well, through studying  and practicing Buddhism. I have come to understand the process of perception by which we construct consensus reality as a rolling series of misunderstandings about the actual nature of reality. This paradigm can accommodate the world view of all the paradigms except straight out positivism which is an exclusive stance.

## Epistemology

At the level of consensus reality, in terms of natuarl science, for example, I’m an empiricist. At this level, knowledge comes from experience. This includes knowledge gained through observation as well as through direct experience.

However, as Hursell observed, the empiricist idea that experience is the foundation of all knowledge is, itself, knowledge that can not be based on experience of the external world. It is based on the experience of being - specifically the experience of being in a world which we experience through our senses as phenomena. This is also a Buddhist perspective but in a Western academic context it is represented by Phenomenology.

I see all the paradigms as valid attitudes to knowledge - except perhaps, again, straight out positivism, which intrinsically tries to invalidate other ways of knowing.

## Methodology

In my inclusive paradigm, all methodologies are valid as long as they are contextually appropriate to the ontological and epistemological stance we have adopted, hopefully to suit our purposes.
