## Methodology

Because my research paradigm is "Artistic/Participatory" and practice-based (in the sense of meaning that the work is the basis of the contribution to knowledge), it follows that the methodology will be "participatory, collaborative, action and practice driven"

## Methods

Some qualitative strategies:

    -   Reflective Practice: An iterative cycle of Reflecting on action and learning from experience
    -   Auto-Ethnography: A form of self-reflection that seeks to document and analyse personal experience in larger cultural, social etc. contexts
    -   Post-textual analysis leaning on Arnheimâ€™s Gestalt theory of aesthetics and  Phenomenology
