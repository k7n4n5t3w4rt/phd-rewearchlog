## Ontology

> Ontology is generally considered to be concerned with the nature of being and reality. What is the nature of reality? What can be said to exist? What is a physical thing?

I'm an ontological Idealist.: "reality is constructed in the mind of the observer" - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTsaZWzVJ4c>
My ontology is "relativist".

## Epistemology

Empiricism - experience and observation.
