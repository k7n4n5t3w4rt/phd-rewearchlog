## Research Paradigm

Our ideas of the nature of reality (ontology) and what is knowable (epistemology) constitute our research paradigm.

## Ontology

> Ontology is generally considered to be concerned with the nature of being and reality. What is the nature of reality? What can be said to exist? What is a physical thing?

Idealist.: "reality is constructed in the mind of the observer" - <https://youtu.be/XTsaZWzVJ4c>

## Epistemology

Empiricism - experience and observation.

## Methodology

    > Methodology on the other hand can be seen as the overarching research framework, system of rule, principles, policies and procedures that guide your research. Methodology in practice-led research is particularly important as the validity and suitability of your methods is going to be held up to greater scrutiny than in more traditional research pathways. Methodology is understanding in practice about making appropriate choices that advance your inquiry. Methodology is constructed by drawing on how you view research and practice, and positions you in relation to ways of knowing.
