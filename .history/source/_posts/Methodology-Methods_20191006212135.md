## Methodology

> Methodology ... can be seen as the overarching research framework, system of rule, principles, policies and procedures that guide your research. ~ https://blackboard.qut.edu.au/webapps/blackboard/execute/displayLearningUnit?course_id=_136508_1&content_id=_7961366_1


## Methods

Some qualitative strategies:

    -   Reflective Practice: An iterative cycle of Reflecting on action and learning from experience
    -   Autoethnography: A form of self-reflection that seeks to document and analyse personal experience in larger cultural, social etc. contexts
    -   Post-textual analysis leaning on Arnheimâ€™s Gestalt theory of aesthetics and  Phenomenology
