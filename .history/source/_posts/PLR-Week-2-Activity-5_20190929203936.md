## Activity 5

_Q. Make a list of key terms, disciplines and subject areas that may be related to your area of practice as well as the principle concepts of your practice._

### Key Terms

- "Mirror Worlds": A term coined by David Gelernter in his 1991 book "Mirror worlds, or, The day software puts the universe in a shoebox : how it will happen and what it will mean." (Gelernter 1991)

- "Internet of Things": A term used to describe "interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people ... with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction" (Wikipedia Contributors 2019)

- "Web of Things": In the same way the Web is a layer of shared protocols (an "application layer") for the Internet (the "network layer"), the Web of Things is a term that describes the proposed standards for an application layer that simplifies the creation of applications for the Internet of Things. Competing approaches include a framework from Mozilla (Mozilla IoT 2019) and a draft specification from the W3C (Web of Things (WoT) Architecture 2017)

- "Machine Learning": Applied statistics, essentially. Algorithms applied to data to generate insights and support decision-making. The term covers the simpler algorithms such as linear algebra when applied to things like natural language processing, and also more complex structures like neural networks, used for things like image recognition. In a network context, machine learning functionality is being offered as a service, for example by Google Cloud Services, Microsoft Axure and Amazon Web Services.
