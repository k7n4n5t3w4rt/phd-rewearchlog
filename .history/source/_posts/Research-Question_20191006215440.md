In practice-based research (in the UTS sense), explores questions about the create act itself (https://youtu.be/b1xQ0eMxZJU?t=230).

The main research question:

    > In what ways, and to what extent, does the increasing blurring of digital technologies and the physical world challenge or change what it is  to be human.

Possible sub-questions:

> What should the stance of the artist be when using the emerging technologies to directly critique those technologies? Specifically, when working with XR related technologies, how can we work effectively with and avoid or address the criticisms levelled at earlier practices such as net art (i.e. it is "radically disconnected" to use Lipard's phrase) or locative art (that it uncritically uses problematic technologies like GPS)?
