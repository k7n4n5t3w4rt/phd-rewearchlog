_1. Write a short note telling us what your aims and/or expectations are for doing a higher research degree_

It's an opportunity to go deeply into a subject and to develop my art practice.

_2. Write a short summary that articulates your research topic or area of investigation_

The title of my research project is "The Collapse of Cyberspace: Spatial Computing and the Web of Things"

I'll be exploring the spatial futures of the world wide web, using 'augmented-reality' artworks that run natively on the world wide web. The dissertation component will deconstruct and comment on the role this kind of art can play in helping us reflect on the emerging operational realities and possibilities of an integrated digital and physical world.

_3. List three keywords relevant to your research (e.g. perception, affect...) and provide a definition (in your own words) along with reference to the relevance of the keyword in relation to your study._

"spatial computing"

A term for the related fields of virtual-reality, augmented-reality, mixed-reality etc. When there's an idea of a "world space", that's spatial computing.

"web of things"

Like the web is a set of shared protocols for connecting services on the internet, the web of things is emerging as a set of shared protocols for connecting services on the internet of things.

"locative art"

Locative art is a practice bound to the technical fields described above and examines with how we interact with information using network technology in a way that is primarily spatial and contextual - and bound to our physical world in a way that is the converse of how similar practices focused on "virtual-reality" are not.

By way of example, here's a description of a work by Linda Dement that I think is good - http://www.lindadement.com/maralinga.htm

## Activity 2

### Ontology

I’m a relativist. I think “reality exists as social, mental and experiential constructs”. To the extent that we all share these constructs - or appear to - then I’m also a constructivist. That which we might call “consensus reality” appears to exist and follow natural laws, with which we can work.

I have internalised another paradigm entirely, through studying Buddhism. I have come to understand the process of perception by which we construct consensus reality as a rolling series of misunderstandings about the actual nature of reality. This paradigm - “the view” as Buddhist practitioners call it - can accommodate the world view of all the paradigms except straight out positivism which is an exclusive stance.

### Epistemology

I’m an empiricist. For me, all knowledge comes from experience. This includes knowledge gained through observation as well as through direct experience. I see all the paradigms as valid attitudes to knowledge - except perhaps, again, straight out positivism, which intrinsically tries to invalidate other ways of knowing.

### Methodology

In my inclusive paradigm, all methodologies are valid as long as they are contextually appropriate to the ontological and epistemological stance we have adopted, hopefully to suit our purposes.

## Activity 3

Q: Why complete the study? Why is it necessary?

The imminent arrival of augmented-reality marks a turning point in the way we interact with the internet, on par with the shift from desktop to mobile. A practice-led research project based on these same technologies, that explores and critiques the new modes of human-computer interaction this shift will bring, is timely.
