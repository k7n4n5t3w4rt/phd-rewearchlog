## Activity 5

_Q. Make a list of key terms, disciplines and subject areas that may be related to your area of practice as well as the principle concepts of your practice._

### Key Terms

- "Mirror Worlds": A term coined by David Gelernter in his 1991 book "Mirror worlds, or, The day software puts the universe in a shoebox : how it will happen and what it will mean." (Gelernter 1991)

- "Internet of Things": A term used to describe "interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction" (Wikipedia Contributors 2019)

- "Web of Things": In the same way the Web (application layer) is a layer of shared protocols for the Internet (network layer), the Web of Things is a term that describes the proposed standards for an application layer that simplifies the creation of applications for the Internet of Things. There are a few competing approaches, including a framework from Mozilla (Mozilla IoT 2019) and a draft specification from the W3C (Web of Things (WoT) Architecture 2017)
