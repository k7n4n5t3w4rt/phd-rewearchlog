## Ontology

I’m a relativist. I think “reality exists as social, mental and experiential constructs”. To the extent that we all share these constructs - or appear to - then I’m also a constructivist. That which we might call “consensus reality” appears to exist and follow natural laws, with which we can work.

I have internalised another paradigm entirely, through studying Buddhism. I have come to understand the process of perception by which we construct consensus reality as a rolling series of misunderstandings about the actual nature of reality. This paradigm can accommodate the world view of all the paradigms except straight out positivism which is an exclusive stance.

## Epistemology

I’m an empiricist. For me, all knowledge comes from experience. This includes knowledge gained through observation as well as through direct experience. I see all the paradigms as valid attitudes to knowledge - except perhaps, again, straight out positivism, which intrinsically tries to invalidate other ways of knowing.

## Methodology

In my inclusive paradigm, all methodologies are valid as long as they are contextually appropriate to the ontological and epistemological stance we have adopted, hopefully to suit our purposes.
