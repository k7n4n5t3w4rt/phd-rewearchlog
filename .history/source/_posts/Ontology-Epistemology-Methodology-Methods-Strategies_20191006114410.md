## Research Paradigm

Our ideas of the nature of reality (ontology) and what is knowable (epistemology) constitute our research paradigm.

## Ontology

> Ontology is generally considered to be concerned with the nature of being and reality. What is the nature of reality? What can be said to exist? What is a physical thing?

Idealist.: "reality is constructed in the mind of the observer" - <https://youtu.be/XTsaZWzVJ4c>

## Epistemology

Empiricism - experience and observation.
