## Research Paradigm

Our ideas of the nature of reality (ontology) and what is knowable (epistemology) constitute our research paradigm.

## Ontology

> Ontology is generally considered to be concerned with the nature of being and reality. What is the nature of reality? What can be said to exist? What is a physical thing?

Idealist.: "reality is constructed in the mind of the observer" - <https://youtu.be/XTsaZWzVJ4c>

## Epistemology

Empiricism - experience and observation.

## Methodology

> Methodology ... can be seen as the overarching research framework, system of rule, principles, policies and procedures that guide your research. ~ https://blackboard.qut.edu.au/webapps/blackboard/execute/displayLearningUnit?course_id=_136508_1&content_id=_7961366_1

## Methods

Some qualitative strategies:

    -   Reflective Practice: Reflecting on action and learning from experience (See: Schön)
    -   Autoethnography: A form of self-reflection that seeks to document and analyse personal experience in larger cultural, social etc. contexts (Garfinkle, 1984)
    -   Post-textual analysis leaning on Arnheim’s Gestalt theory of aesthetics and    Phenomenology:
