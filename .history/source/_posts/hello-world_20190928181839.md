# Activity 1

1. Write a short note telling us what your aims and/or expectations are for doing a higher research degree

It's an opportunity to go deeply into a subject and to develop my art practice.

2. Write a short summary that articulates your research topic or area of investigation

The title of my research project is "The Collapse of Cyberspace: Spatial Computing and the Web of Things"

I'll be exploring the spatial futures of the world wide web, using 'augmented-reality' artworks that run natively on the world wide web. The dissertation component will deconstruct and comment on the role this kind of art can play in helping us reflect on the emerging operational realities and possibilities of an integrated digital and physical world.

3. List three keywords relevant to your research (e.g. perception, affect...) and provide a definition (in your own words) along with reference to the relevance of the keyword in relation to your study.

"spatial computing"

A term for the related fields of virtual-reality, augmented-reality, mixed-reality etc. When there's an idea of a "world space", that's spatial computing.

"web of things"

Like the web is a set of shared protocols for connecting services on the internet, the web of things is emerging as a set of shared protocols for connecting services on the internet of things.

"locative art"

Locative art is a practice bound to the technical fields described above and examines with how we interact with information using network technology in a way that is primarily spatial and contextual - and bound to our physical world in a way that is the converse of how similar practices focused on "virtual-reality" are not.

By way of example, here's a description of a work by Linda Dement that I think is good - http://www.lindadement.com/maralinga.htm
