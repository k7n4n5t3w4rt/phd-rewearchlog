> Provide a brief outline of your overarching research design/framework and identify three key methods you plan to employ within your study.

Because my research paradigm is "Artistic/Participatory" and practice-based (in the sense of meaning that the work is the basis of the contribution to knowledge), it follows that the methodology will be "action and practice driven" (not so much "participatory" and "collaborative" simply because of the solo nature of my process).

The methods will be necessarily qualitative. At this stage I'm thinking:

  -   Reflective Practice: An iterative cycle of Reflecting on action and learning from experience
  -   Autoethnography: A form of self-reflection that seeks to document and analyse personal experience in larger cultural, social etc. contexts
  -   Exhibition and post-textual analysis leaning on Arnheimâ€™s Gestalt theory of aesthetics and phenomenology

An iterative process will allow the project to develop. Documenting the process will allow me to retrace the evolution of key questions or insights that might come up unexpectedly. It seems important to include the viewer into the process and the exhibition and analysis of the finished work should do this.

I'll need to keep a journal, probably online, probably this one.

I'll use git for source control, so there will be a history I can reference at any time. I'll also include descriptions in the README.md file of the repository and extensive commenting in the source code describing my intentions and thinking as I go.

> How will the creative work be presented and documented? Is the experience of working within your practice different now you have embarked on a research degree...if so how?

Sketching and drawing will be part of the process for each work. This is something I sometimes do, but I think moving from drawing to code will probably be a key part of the process as a research.
