<p>So far we’ve been focusing on making the thing work. We were doing that developer thing - assuming that once the thing works people will flock to use it. but they’re not. BenkoBot uses code and Trello users like Trello because it isn’t code.</p>
<p>There’s that. But also, it just doesn’t have a personality. There’s no brand. I think we need to really turn up the “botness” of BenkoBot so that even if people don’t want to use it at least they know where it stands. You make a bot and it’s your bot.</p>
<p>The BenkoBot logo is good. I think I can do something with that maybe. Of maybe a “great robots of history” sort of thing. Anyway, I’m going to start by changing the <code>/setup</code> page to be all about setting up your bot.</p>

          <p><img width="100%" alt="The first constraint map? This is the one we just did for Contour556 Safari" src="/images/constraint-flower-1.png" /></p>
<p>Tim and I did this the other night when we first talked about the idea of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://devlog.brokenbaysoftware.co/2021/07/26/Contour556-Safari/">AR Pokemon Go type type thing for Contour556 in 2022</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We started with the hard boundary “Contour556”. I drew it and then said, in a ritualised fashion. “Contour556. This is a hard boundary because… we’re either in or out.”</li>
<li>I drew ”device capability” with a dotted line. I said “This is a fuzzy boundary because… there are many devices and capabilities are changing all the time”</li>
<li>Tim said “available time”. I drew it as a dotted line and said “This is a fuzzy boundary because we don’t know how much time we will have”</li>
<li>I drew “deadline” as a solid line and said “This is a hard boundary because it’s a hard deadline in 2022”</li>
<li>I drew “Canberra” as a dotted line and said “This is a fuzzy boundary because the theme of the artwork has to be about Canberra (Tim said ‘Does it??’)… but it’s very broadly interpreted by most people”</li>
<li>I drew “AR” and said “This is a fuzzy boundary because there are so many different ARs - location, image marker, SLAM etc.</li>
<li>I drew “Pandemic” and said “This is a fuzzy boundary because we don’t know what it will be like in 2022 but we need to account for many possibilities”</li>
</ul>
<p>We then went into the centre and I explained my idea for Pokemon Go at Contour556 - how everyone knows Pokemon Go and we serious AR artists try to ignore it. But we can play with it instead. When I mentioned creatures Tim immediately started thinking about the modelling involved in making good characters. That led to a new boundary:</p>
<ul>
<li>I drew a dotted line and said “Modelling effort is a fuzzy boundary because we could have different sorts of characters - from Toy Story to 2D or particle clouds</li>
</ul>
<p>That led to a discussion about different characters we could make. We came up with some interesting characters that would be easy to model:</p>
<ul>
<li>2D aliens that live on a wall</li>
<li>Particle clouds</li>
<li>Low polygon creatures</li>
<li>Existing models</li>
</ul>
<p>I turned the dotted line into a hard line for “modelling effort“ and said “This is a harder boundary now because we’ve narrowed it down.”</p>
<p>I had the idea that refining the idea might be a process of hardening up boundaries. First i put in stickies for the things and people inside the area of possibility created by the boundaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>People</li>
<li>Creatures</li>
<li>Instagram</li>
<li>Buildings</li>
</ul>
<p>We talked about it being on Instagram and I made the “device capability” a solid line and said “This is now a hard boundary because it’s whatever works on Instagram and nothing else”.</p>
<p>I added to the area of possibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scooters</li>
</ul>
<p>We thought abut what other boundaries we could harden up:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Canberra” became a hard boundary because the creatures will be site-specific</li>
<li>“AR” became a hard boundary because it’s now whatever works on Instagram</li>
</ul>
<p>We started listing buildings and then added some to the area of possibility. We talked about the NSA being in charge of the land. I added a sticky for it and then we had to finish. I would have made that into a boundary if we hadn’t stopped.</p>

          <blockquote>
<p>When we talk about the phylum Chordata we’re talking about a style. Isn’t it vertebrates a kind of style? You can tell them apart immediately from the phylum Arthropoda which is insects. And insects in all the incredible variety of forms form a style.</p>
<p>And so what Deleuze would say is styles didn’t need us to come into being. It’s the other way around. Nature has styles and it is we humans that need to learn from that because we are part of it. We are made out of flesh and blood we are one of those styles. In order to assert our singularity, our uniqueness, our difference, it is important of course that we need to start considering all the different forms of difference - difference in variation difference, in intensity difference in in the kind of differential calculus that I just said - that exist in nature, that power nature, and try to use it.</p>
<p>A lot of times we use those things unconsciously. We are simply good artists that don’t know how to explain what we do. But we can. We can tell about intensities. We can tell whether a painting strikes us, or is powerful or, on the other hand, is subdued because it’s subdued on purpose. And you’re playing with intensity. It’s not necessarily using that vocabulary.</p>
<p>Now the last thing that Deleuze would want to do is impose a particular ideology on art because artists are the search process. They are the kind of probe head at the tip of the search and so Deleuze always kind of let them pass. Proust and Kafka are the creators. He followed them. Rather than say “oh well I’m better than Kafka and Proust” he quotes them as people who saw - who drove humanity in a particularly intense direction. He wrote a couple of books on cinema. He wrote about Francis Bacon and painting. He writes quite a bit of about music in a thousand plateaus with Felix Guattari. So for him artists are the… cutting edge of this process.</p>
<p>What he would want is that when artists begin to talk about their art that they would have a better vocabulary. Instead of deconstructing things when … the word “deconstruction” they don’t even know what it means… So what Deleuze would want to do is yes, do art, but the moment you start talking about your art don’t go hide behind those funky words. Use words that mean something because the last thing we want artists to be doing is giving us these pseudo explanations of their art cast it in the latest terminology”</p>

          <p>Maybe because I’ve been reading “Aramis, or the Love of Technology” by Latour.</p>
<p>I’ve aways had Pokemon Go hanging over me when I make AR(t). I feel like I’m going to be explaining what I’m doing to somebody and they’re going to say “oh, you mean like Pokemon Go?”. Suddenly this morning I thought “what if we extend the frame?”. The Field of AR contains Pokemon Go. Rather than just ignoring the elephant in the room, why not bring that in as a component and play with it?</p>

<p>Instead of stupid, cute pokemon we could have amazing, diverse creatures with lives and connections to the community. Instead of capturing them, we do something else - like pay tribute to them like at a Shinto shrine. Different groups could be involved in the design of their creature and it’s backstory.</p>

[3] Here's an idea. Everyone knows how to use Pokemon Go. It's the AR thing that serious artists and everyone else trying to progress AR tries to ignore. Suddenly this morning I thought “what if we extend the frame?”. The Field of AR contains Pokemon Go. Rather than just ignoring the elephant in the room, why not bring that in as a component and play with it?

in fact, we partner with everybody. make it a totally integrated Canberra thing
fabulous beasts inhabit the special buildings and places around the lake. it's like The Monster That Ate Canberra except there are lots of monsters
people can redeem monster sightings at the businesses in that area - if you capture a monster and upload it you get a token for a free thing, etc
also, the monsters all have cool music
aquatic monsters in the lake
dreamtime monsters at some special places - partner up with a Ngunnawal org -->

          <p>I think maybe because we’re coders - and maybe because we’re essentially building a better version of ButlerBot - we were shying away from the whole “bot” thing. It occurred to me this week that the “setup” process should really be the “set up your bot”, or even “my bot”, process.</p>
<p>When BenkoBot runs, I always get a shock to see things attributed to me because it was my API key and token that authenticated against the Trello API. I know I will feel much better about it when I see things attributed to the “BenkoBot”.</p>
<p>”The BenkoBot”. It’s the bot that did it, not me officer. Why don’t you ask him about that Trello comment?</p>
<p>I think it’s because Adrian and I are using the same Trello board a lot. We’re looking out for each other’s comments. Once I made a bot that commented “Well done getting this one through to Done” and Adrian assumed it was my personal comment and responded. Kind of awkward. Awkward is not a selling point.</p>

          <p>I plan to set a constraint for myself: I use vanilla JS with the bare minimum of libraries - like Preact or React.</p>
<p>One practical reason is that the space is in flux and there are competing proprietary libraries for web AR. Not all of them will survive. The lesson from ManifestAR is not to build your art on somebody else’s platform.</p>
<p>Another reason is that the makers of the various competing libraries and products are doing the same thing. It puts me in the same space as them.</p>
<p>Also, I want to feel the limits and possibilities of AR on the web very directly. I want to work very deeply with the technology, not be caught up in trying to do the next shiny thing with AR.</p>
<p>UPDATE: It turns out there are a lot of useful libraries for working with location. I probably need to refine this constraint:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can use services, like Firebase because that’s the web these days</li>
<li>I can use NodeJS or other Javascript libraries created by other people, as long as they’re not dependent on a service.</li>

          <p>Wardley Maps are based on Simon Wardley’s observation that everything humans do (technology, concepts, etc) change state in ways that are broadly predictable. We can’t tell when or how it will happen, but we know what things move through a spectrum of states from Genesys &gt; Custom &gt; Product (or Rental) &gt; Commodity. The change from one state to anther is a phase shift and strategy is essentially the business of acting deliberately to lead or forestall the shift from left to right along map of these states.</p>
<p>Assemblage Theory talks about phase shifts that happen when the internal conditions of an assemblage change in a way that shift the relationship of perameterised the concepts (DeLanda) “territorialisation” and “codification”. For example, water in certain conditions will phase shift from a liquid to a solid. How might the phase changes of a Wardley Map and the phase changes of Assemblage Theory be related?</p>
<p>In the Genesys phase, we might say that the assemblage has low territorialisation and low codification.</p>
<p>In the Custom phase, we might say that the assemblage is medium territorialisation and medium codification.</p>
<p>In the Pruduct/Rental phase, we might say that the assemblage is highly territorialised and more than moderately codified.</p>
<p>In the Commodity phase, we might say that the assemblage has a very low degreee of territorialisation and is highly codified.</p>

          <p>Today I was using the Readout tool with the CommSee SMs who are interested in doing the pilot. I decided it was worth getting it working because of the difficulties in working remotely with these folks in India. People have their video off for various reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Poor connections (like, mobile phones using 2G or 3G) in rural India</li>
<li>Different communication styles - they’re quiet</li>
<li>Having video on is a signal that you’re taking the lead in the meeting</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a big group of about 14 people and we needed to make some decisions.</p>
<p>I put the link in teams chat but people couldn’t access it on the bank network due to security settings. They could use their phones (lucky it works on mobile) but that meant typing in the URL manually.</p>
<pre><code>NEW REQUIREMENT: Short URLs
</code></pre><p>In the end it was pretty good. We got a useful readout and decided to spend the weekly sessions focusing on the pilot.</p>
<p>I tried a few different labels for the poles of the dyad slider but some were not URL friendly.</p>
<pre><code>NEW REQUIREMENT: Base64 encoded URL parameter values
</code></pre><p>We had a lot of trouble sharing around the URL.</p>
<pre><code>NEW REQUIREMENT: Custom session IDs so we can use one generic input view and customised `/readout` views for different questions.
</code></pre><p>I realised that we need to display the question as a visual cue.</p>
<pre><code>NEW REQUIREMENT: Question
</code></pre><p>If we’re going to be using the same URL as input for a session with multiple questions, we need to be able to clear the existing inputs. This is especially a problem if someone drops off mid-call. Without the ability to clear the history, their last recorded position will just stay there forever.</p>
<pre><code>NEW REQUIREMENT: Clear history
</code></pre><p>UPDATE: THE NEXT DAY…</p>
<p>I woke up late and started tweaking it again. It wasn’t really working on iPad.</p>
<pre><code>NEW REQUIREMENT: Make the Readout view open in a new tab
</code></pre><p>I also fixed a problem I noticed when opening on the iPad from the home screen shortcut. It’s feeling pretty good on the iPad and I put a test up in Gentle Agile Folk Slack to try it out.</p>

<p>As soon as I did (which is interesting, perhaps), I realised that it needs some feedback when you move the slider. Maybe a little message that appears front and center and then fades away so you can do it many times.</p>
<pre><code>NEW REQUIREMENT: Feedback after moving slider.

          <p>When I was at TAFE in the mid-90s, learning the various crafts of art-making, I made sculpture called “Piece Missing”. It was an anomally.</p>
<p>The classes were things like Objective Drawing, Experimental Drawing, Life Drawing, Painting, Colour Theory, Printmaking etc. For the final assessment we were expected to present almost the amount of work you would do if you were making a piece of work every class - not every course, every class. And we had multiple classes per day. That’s a lot of work.</p>
<p>But still, I made an extra piece of work and submitted it. It was a strange sculpture that came out of nowhere, apparently. It was and ugly geometric lump made out of plaster and painted black. It was essentially a conceptual work and the explanation was something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Piece Missing
-------------

When we make an artwork we&apos;re bringing something into the world that didn&apos;t previously exist. How can this be? All we&apos;re really doing is re-arranging materials that exist in the world already. Where does this new thing come from? In what sense is it new? This work is not a new thing, it is the negative space, an absense of that new thing which hasn&apos;t yet been made. This work is the universe wrapping itself around the shape of something new which doesn&apos;t yet exist.
</code></pre><p>So there you go. In my first year of learning how to make art since I left school, I was handing in a sculpture that was claiming to be the whole universe. Really, I was asking the question “How is it possible to create something new?” and this is still the question I’m asking.</p>
