          <p>Jennifer A. McMahon’s “materialist” aesthetics would seem to have very interesting practical applications for anyone considering the role of art in human systems and how it might be deployed strategically to affect positive change for communities and organisations. I am particularly interested in the possibilities that might exist for using art more effectively when applying complex-adaptive systems theory as practiced by Dave Snowden and the community centered around his Cynefin framework. Interestingly, “Aesthetics &amp; Semiotics” is the theme for a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cognitive-edge.com/events/cynefin-virtual-retreat-everywhere/">Cynefin Virtual Retreat later this month</a>.</p>
<p>This book is an update to Immanuel Kant’s <em>Critique of Judgment</em> published in 1790. In it, McMahon addresses what she takes to be the least convincing aspects of Kant’s theory of aesthetic judgment and establishes a framework she calls “critical aesthetic realism” that reconciles two standard aesthetic theories, which McMahon calls “cognitivism” and “formalism”. McMahon makes her argument coherently, and methodically, so that even a reader without knowledge of Kant’s work can follow her reasoning to some extent.</p>
<p>The starting point for McMahon’s theory is an acceptance that our minds are in some way continuous with the world because our consciousness in some way arises out of our physical being. We have minds and bodies which exist to some extent together in a physical world. This might not seem like a stretch but there are other ontological positions and this materialist approach grounds her theory of aesthetics in our shared human context (the world, community, etc) and makes it practically applicable to the complex-adaptive systems we’re all interested in around here.</p>
<p>She then makes the logical assumption that the way we perceive must have an evolutionary aspect. Basically, we have the ability/addiction to perceive qualities in the world that make it an ok place in which to live. We are capable of experiencing nature as a coherent synthesis with a high degree of harmony - as “beautiful”, in other words. Put bluntly, we experience nature as embodying concepts that are imaginary but very, very important when you’re a pattern-matching ape.</p>
<p><img src="https://bigseventravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screenshot-2019-06-18-at-09.32.14.png" alt="New Zealand: Pretty beautiful"></p>
<p><em>Source: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bigseventravel.com/2019/06/beautiful-new-zealand/">https://bigseventravel.com/2019/06/beautiful-new-zealand/</a></em></p>
<p>Art-making comes from this ability we have to perceive beauty. It is basically a hack on our evolutionary predisposition to imbue external objects with positive properties that don’t have any actual perceptual counterparts in the natural world. Drawing on contemporary work in computational cognition (machine learning), McMahon explains the perceptual process we go through when we relate to an object aesthetically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given that perception involves “form plus concept” when we experience … form for which there is no concept, the system responds automatically by finding a concept for which there is no form. The result is that we apprehend a form which … evokes a deeply affecting experience related to a state which we desire, even unconsciously. (McMahon 2007, p. 14)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The process of making art and the process of perceiving it are complementary because they’re based on the same hard-wired perceptual process.</p>
<p>McMahon says we experience an art object’s “aesthetic properties” as being objectively real. We can feel passionately that an object actually embodies certain qualities and we expect people around us to share our perception of these qualities, or at least be capable of experiencing these qualities. We might explain our perception of an art object to another person in order to convince them a quality exists. We might feel the need to provide context, such as what we know about the artist’s intentions or the social context of the work.</p>
<p>Context is everything for art. Art objects may lose their aesthetic qualities when their context shifts. For example, when we look at art produced in an earlier time, we need to recontextualise it if we are to relate to it as an aesthetic object rather than a historical artifact. This kind of recontextualisation might be observed as the highlighting of different aspects to those that were originally considered significant when the work was produced. Conversely, new artworks may initially (or forever) be unavailable as aesthetic objects for people who don’t share enough social context with the artists who are producing them. Impressionism, for example, was famously problematic for many people when artists first started painting in the new style. But things change and that is the point.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.theartwolf.com/articles/impressionism/manet-olympia.jpg" alt="Olympia by Édouard Manet"></p>
<p><em>Olympia by Édouard Manet, 1863 (Source: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.theartwolf.com/articles/50-impressionist-paintings.htm">http://www.theartwolf.com/articles/50-impressionist-paintings.htm</a>)</em></p>
<p>The shared process of making art and accepting art as beautiful is an intrinsic part of building community. We use art-making to reinforce existing communal patterning and we can use it to catalyse the system around new states. Practitioners working with anthro-complexity could be making much more effective use of this innate tendency we have to create and perceive beauty. I think this is what Dave Snowden was talking about when he said recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Art can allow us to combine at a level of abstraction. So it’s a low energy form of entanglement because it allows meaning and identity to flow very quickly. That’s one of the functions of abstraction, or “aesthetics” or “semiotics”. I think one of the things we’re neglecting to some extent is the role of abstraction…but we need to see abstraction as an aspect of our material world not of the spiritual world in that sense because abstraction evolved in humans to allow us to make novel or unusual connections. (Snowden 2020, 20:29)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This “abstraction” is not necessarily stylistic abstraction, although it can be of course. I think Dave is referring to the way we can perceive, in fact the way we must perceive, important shared cultural concepts as being present in external objects. We can see organisations trying to do this by creating artifacts like vision statements and strategy decks but these are lame artifacts in every sense. What is an organisation except a community of people with a shared context? How effective could it be to really engage at the level of art with the core aspirations and practical realities of an organisation?</p>
<p>This sort of work cuts across some big silos. It will take extremely mindful practitioners who are skilled in complexity work and art making - or a collaboration between specialists in both fields. I think deep work like this is necessary if we’re going to make positive change in the conditions that exist in our communities and organisations.</p>

          <p>WebAR is built on WebGL, and the library for working with WebGL is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>, invented by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">mrdoob</a>. Before learning webAR, I thought I should do a couple of experiments with three.js so that I understood some of the basic concepts. Also, I wanted to test out my <a href="../../17/ES-Preact-Boilerplate-AKA-Goodthing/">boilerplate</a>.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://sketches.brokenbaysoftware.co/lines1/">Lines1</a> is a line generated from a 100 random points. Not random exactly but random within a range around the last point that was generated.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://sketches.brokenbaysoftware.co/lines2/">Lines2</a> is the same thing but 100… or a 1000, i can’t remember… lines are generated at once and rendered to the scene.</p>
<p>The key learnings were:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use three.js with a <code>useEffect()</code> hook in a Preact component - kind of cheating but a nice way to just do vanilla JS with Preact/React</li>
<li>Working out how to re-render</li>
<li>Getting the thing to go full screen on tap</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing three.js inside <code>useEffect()</code> is basically just a mess of side effects. Not very functional at all. The approach I’ve use so far is very procedural - set up all the properties for the scene things and then render, then do this onTapEnd, etc. It’s very oldschool. One idea might be to use RX.js but I’m wondering if it’s worth it. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aframe.io/docs/1.0.0/introduction/">A-Frame</a> is an HTML-like, declarative wrapper around three.js. It might be better to just use that and hide away all the funny business.</p>
<p>Looking ahead at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/">AR.js docs</a>, all the examples use AR.js. There is a version of AR.js that uses three.js directly without A-Frame but there aren’t any actual examples in the docs showing how to use it, just some repos on GitHub. So, the next step is probably to try out Goodthing with AR.js.</p>

          <p>“An enabling constraint… is what lowers energy barriers and facilitates the flow of information or ideas - or energy. “Restrictive constraints”… are processes or events that lift - or raise or add or create - impedances to energy flow.” (19:10)</p>

<p>“Typologies are wonderful because they force you to think. Particularly if you create matrices where you’ve got to fit all the boxes because it forces you to think of things in the boxes it’s a good sense-making technique.” (28:00) ~ Snowden, D. 2020, Exploring the Entanglements of COVID-19, video recording, Wistia, viewed 17 May 2020, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cognitive-edge.wistia.com/medias/tld9bso9ca">https://cognitive-edge.wistia.com/medias/tld9bso9ca</a></p>
<p>“The things which I’m interested in are where we can catalyse entanglement. Now, the scary thing is that’s what Trump does. Every time Trump tweets he catalyzes an attractor-well. He’s not actually arguing logically or structured, what he’s doing is increasing the entanglement of a set of tropes or belief systems with certain key phrases - and every time he’s attacked on that effectively it becomes stronger not weaker. Key phrases can catalyse tropes, strange attractors or assemblages. I think there is piece of work which has to be done to take Deleuze’s concept of “assemblages”, “strange attractors” in complexity and “tropes” in narrative theory because I actually think they’re all the same thing - but we need a … theoretical alignment on those three.</p>
<p>One of the issues is: how to we catalyse an energy gradient which tends towards creating something better rather than something worse? My fundamental belief - and this is the basis of SenseMaker - is that you have to map where you are and make small changes from the present - and if you don’t map where you are, and you define where you want to be, you’re going to miss the weak signals. So the mapping to me is always key. I think the other thing there is the concept of coherence which I don’t think any of us have really worked on enough in complexity theory… I think we need to think about: what are the points of coherence where entanglement is possible? If you can find a point of coherence where we can entangle, then the energy cost of that entanglement producing outcomes is actually lower.</p>
<p>Human beings have learned how to be deliberative and one of the ways that we entangle is through abstractions. It’s one of the roles of art. Art can allow us to combine at a level of abstraction. So it’s a low energy form of entanglement because it allows meaning and identity to flow very quickly. That’s one of the functions of abstraction, or “aesthetics” or “semiotics”. I think one of the things we’re neglecting to some extent is the role of abstraction…but we need to see abstraction as an aspect of our material world not of the spiritual world in that sense because abstraction evolved in humans to allow us to make novel or unusual connections.” (29:00) ~ Snowden, D. 2020, Exploring the Entanglements of COVID-19, video recording, Wistia, viewed 17 May 2020, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cognitive-edge.wistia.com/medias/tld9bso9ca">https://cognitive-edge.wistia.com/medias/tld9bso9ca</a></p>

          <p>I needed to learn how to code again and I couldn’t bare the thought of ploughing into create-react-app again. Somehow I got onto <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://legacy.snowpack.dev/#quick-start">Snowpack</a> and Preact etc. It seems like there’s an updated to Snowpack I need to look into.</p>
<p>So, I made a boilerplate for new projects that don’t need to be compiled during development:</p>

<p>I also wrote a test framework called “Testy” that’s part of the repo. There are better test frameworks out there but Testy is lightweight and runs as javascript, not as a binary, so I can just run it in VSCode debug mode.</p>

          <p>“During a period of stability any eco-system has an apex predator around which the eco-system organises… but when instability hits matters get problematic. The old ideas have reached maturity and the ecosystem is changing faster than can be understood or comprehended… At this point a low energy cost, adaptive entity can stabilise a new ecosystem, create a new way of thinking.” ~ <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://cognitive-edge.com/blog/it-never-troubles-the-wolf-how-many-the-sheep-may-be/">http://cognitive-edge.com/blog/it-never-troubles-the-wolf-how-many-the-sheep-may-be/</a></p>
<p>As we move into the early majority stage of the life cycle of a product or an idea then there is a lot of diversity in the system, with interdependency. As the system matures that diversity starts to be reduced and as the idea reaches maturity diversity is minimal. That lack of diversity allows for new ideas to emerge in the fringe of the system (the early adopters). Initially dismissed and often contradictory one will emerge as the most flexible, adaptive to context and stables the next eco-system. So as the new apex predator establishes itself the variety is reduced and the distribution shifts from Pareto to Gaussian, things become more predicable. But as the system becomes increasingly homogenised the maverick ideas start to emerge left field. We then get a catalytic event which creates mass heterogeneity. Before and immediately after this we pay attention to the tails of distributions and we hit negative patterns early and fast – there is no predictability. ~ <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://cognitive-edge.com/blog/integration-and-an-alarmist-implication/">http://cognitive-edge.com/blog/integration-and-an-alarmist-implication/</a></p>

          <p>Yesterday I went to “Teamlab Borderless”, a digital art extravaganza located in the “entertainment” quarter of Tokyo. Inside a 6 storey parking-lot/shopping-mall type of building, nestled beneath the “Giant Sky Wheel in Palette Town” and next to the Megaweb Toyota City Showcase. I lined up for 40 minutes even though I had bought tickets online.</p>
<p>It’s two floors and there are different spaces and rooms. The “borderless” part is the way that the artworks move around the spaces. Some rooms are pretty much set because they’re custom made with harware or architectural features, like an uneven floor, trampolines and slides. In most places you and interact with the projections that don’t feel like projections. You don’t get projections on your body when you stand in front of the wall, and you don’t cast a shadow onto any surface. I couldn’t work out how they do that - probably a combination of oblique angles and projections of the same thing from different angles. The effect is much like AR but, of course, there’s no head-gear.</p>
<p>Today I put three thoughts together for the first time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Augmented-space</li>
<li>Assemblage</li>
<li>Complexity</li>
</ol>
<p>Augmented space is what we get when we mix digital technology and the physical world. An assemblage is a combination of things that is more than the sum of it’s parts. A complex system is a network of things, loosely coupled, that exhibits emergent behaviours. Augmented space is an assemblage with which we can work if we follow the principles of complexity theory.</p>

          <p>The first is Neuromancer written by William Gibson in 1984. This book spawned a SciFi genre called “cyberpunk”. In it, Gibson used the term “cyberspace” (coined a few years earlier in a short story) and described a networked data-space called the “matrix” that was basically a VR interface for the internet. Pretty amazing considering the internet had barely existed for about a year before the book came out.</p>
<p>The second is another William Gibson book written 23 years later called Spook Country. In contrast to the far future setting of Neuromancer, this story is an alternative history of the near (like, 12 months) past. Locative art (where virtual scultptures are situated in real locations) is part of the plot.</p>
<p>I think these works are important to the project because they’re both by GIbson and show a change in his understanding over time. This is from an interview with Gibson in 2007:</p>
<p>When I started, I thought that the “locative art” stuff would work the way immersion technology did in my earlier fiction. Then I started liking that it wasn’t going to do that…cyberspace is inverting, turning inside out. I have a feeling that being aware of being connected will be an anachronism, because we’ll be connected all the time. I have this inkling that the whole idea of cyberspace is going to seem fabulously quaint in 20 or 30 years. ~ <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/35536/">http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/35536/</a></p>
